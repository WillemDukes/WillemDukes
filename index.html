          I am a sophomore ISAT student with interests in
          <strong>systems thinking</strong>, <strong>sustainability</strong>,
          and <strong>applied problem-solving</strong>.
          I enjoy translating complex systems into clear, real-world solutions
          through hands-on projects.

        <h2>Environmental Education &amp; Trail Signage System</h2>
        <p><strong>Eagle Scout Service Project | Fish River Nature Preserve</strong></p>

        <p>
          As a junior in high school, I partnered with the
          <strong>South Alabama Land Trust (SALT)</strong>
          to design and implement a permanent educational signage system for
          the Fish River Nature Preserve in Fairhope, Alabama.
          The goal of the project was to improve visitor understanding of local
          ecosystems while providing clear navigation throughout the trail.
        </p>

        <p>
          I conducted on-site trail walkthroughs to collect
          <strong>GIS data</strong>, which I used to create a detailed digital
          trail map in <strong>Google My Maps</strong>.
          The map included waypoints corresponding to each sign location and
          supported both installation planning and future trail management.
        </p>

        <p>
          I developed two primary types of signage:
          <strong>five ecosystem information boards</strong> describing distinct
          ecological zones, and <strong>fifteen plant identification signs</strong>
          highlighting native and invasive species throughout the preserve.
        </p>

        <p>
          I coordinated directly with <strong>Pulse Design</strong> to finalize
          sign layouts and materials, prioritizing durability and readability in
          an outdoor environment. After fabrication, I recruited and led
          volunteer teams to install the signage along the 1.6-mile trail,
          managing logistics, safety, and workflow throughout the process.
