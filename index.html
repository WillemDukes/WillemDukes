        <h2>Environmental Education &amp; Trail Signage System</h2>
        <p><strong>Eagle Scout Service Project | Fish River Nature Preserve</strong></p>

        <p>
          As a junior in high school, I partnered with the <strong>South Alabama Land Trust (SALT)</strong>
          to design and implement a signage system for the Fish River Nature Preserve in Fairhope, AL.
          The goal of the project was to improve visitor understanding of local ecosystems while providing
          clear navigation throughout the trail.
        </p>

        <p>
          I developed two primary types of signage: <strong>5 ecosystem information boards</strong> describing
          the different ecological zones within the preserve, and <strong>15 plant identification signs</strong>
          highlighting native and invasive species.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the beginning of the project, I conducted on-site trail walkthroughs to collect
          <strong>GIS data</strong>. I used this data to create a detailed digital trail map
          using Google My Maps, complete with waypoints corresponding to each sign location.
          This map supported both installation planning and future trail management.
        </p>

        <p>
          I coordinated directly with <b>Pulse Design</b> to finalize sign layouts and materials, 
          prioritizing durability and readability in an outdoor setting. Once fabrication was complete, I 
          recruited and led volunteer teams to install the signage along the 1.6-mile trail, managing 
          logistics, safety, and workflow throughout the installation process.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Skills Demonstrated:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Project planning &amp; execution across multiple phases and stakeholders</li>
          <li>Leadership &amp; volunteer coordination in a real-world outdoor environment</li>
          <li>Stakeholder communication with land trust staff and design professionals</li>
          <li>GIS data collection &amp; spatial mapping for trail planning and signage placement</li>
          <li>Public-facing technical communication for environmental education</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Outcome:</strong>
          Successfully delivered a fully mapped 1.6-mile trail system featuring over 20 professionally 
          designed signs. The project provided visitor navigation, increased public awareness of local 
          ecology and invasive species, and provided SALT with durable, long-term educational infrastructure.
