        <p>
          I am a sophomore ISAT student with interests in
          systems thinking, sustainability,
          and applied problem-solving.
          I enjoy translating complex systems into clear, real-world solutions
          through hands-on projects.

          <h2>Environmental Education &amp; Trail Signage System</h2>
          <p><strong>Eagle Scout Service Project | Fish River Nature Preserve</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p>
          As a junior in high school, I partnered with the
          <strong>South Alabama Land Trust (SALT)</strong>
          to design and implement a permanent educational signage system for
          Fish River Nature Preserve in Fairhope, Alabama.
          The goal of the project was to improve visitor understanding of local
          ecosystems while providing clear navigation throughout the trail.
        </p>

        <p>
          Early on in the project, I conducted on-site trail walkthroughs to collect
          <strong>GIS data</strong>, which I used to create a detailed digital
          trail map in <strong>Google My Maps</strong>.
          The map included waypoints corresponding to each sign location and
          supported both installation planning and future trail management.
        </p>

          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
          After I collected the GIS data, I developed two primary types of signage:
          <strong>five ecosystem information boards</strong> describing distinct
          ecological zones, and <strong>fifteen plant identification signs</strong>
          highlighting native and invasive species throughout the preserve.
        </p>

        <p>
          I coordinated directly with <strong>Pulse Design</strong> to finalize
          sign layouts and materials, prioritizing durability and readability in
          an outdoor environment. After fabrication, I recruited and led
          volunteer teams to install the signage along the 1.6-mile trail,
          managing logistics, safety, and workflow throughout the process.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Skills Demonstrated:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Project planning &amp; execution across multiple phases and stakeholders</li>
          <li>Leadership &amp; volunteer coordination in a real-world outdoor environment</li>
          <li>Stakeholder communication with land trust staff and design professionals</li>
          <li>GIS data collection &amp; spatial mapping for trail planning and signage placement</li>
          <li>Public-facing technical communication for environmental education</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Outcome:</strong>
          Successfully delivered a fully mapped <strong>1.6-mile trail system</strong>
          featuring over 20 professionally designed signs.
          The project improved visitor navigation, increased public awareness
          of local ecology and invasive species, and provided SALT with durable,
          long-term educational infrastructure.
